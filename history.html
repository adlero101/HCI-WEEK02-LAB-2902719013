      <strong> Mataram Kingdom (8th–10th century CE)</strong>
According to the Canggal inscription dated 732 CE, the area traditionally known as "Mataram" became the capital of the Medang Kingdom, identified as Mdang i Bhumi Mataram established by King Sanjaya of Mataram. The inscription was found in a Hindu temple in Central Java, 40 km away from Yogyakarta and 20 km away from the giant Borobudur temple complex. This Hindu temple itself was on the border between the area of the Hindu Sanjaya dynasty and the area of the Buddhist Shailendra dynasty.

        The archipelago's strategic location fostered inter-island and international exchange with
        civilisations from the Indian subcontinent and mainland China, profoundly influencing
        Indonesian history and culture through trade. By the 7th century CE, the Srivijaya naval
        kingdom thrived on trade, adopting Hindu and Buddhist influences. The 8th to 10th centuries
        saw the rise and decline of the Buddhist Sailendra and Hindu Mataram dynasties, leaving
        monumental legacies like the Borobudur and Prambanan temples. After the failed Mongol invasion
        of Java in the late 13th century,the Hindu Majapahit kingdom rose to dominate much of the
        archipelago under Gajah Mada's leadership—a period often called the "Golden Age" of Indonesian
        history. Islam arrived in the 13th century in northern Sumatra, and following gradual adoption
        in other islands, it became the dominant religion in Java and Sumatra by the 16th century,
        blending with pre-existing traditions to form a distinct Islamic culture, particularly in
        Java.

        Mataram became the centre of a refined and sophisticated Javanese Hindu-Buddhist culture for about three centuries in the heartland of the Progo River valley, on the southern slopes of Mount Merapi volcano.
         This time period witnessed the construction of numerous candi, including Borobudur and Prambanan.

Around the year 929 CE, the last ruler of the Sanjaya dynasty, King Mpu Sindok of Mataram, moved the seat of power of the Mataram Kingdom from Central Java to East Java and thus established the Isyana dynasty. 
The exact cause of the move is still uncertain; however, a severe eruption from Mount Merapi or a power struggle with the Sumatra-based Srivijaya kingdom probably caused the move.

    Historians suggest that some time during the reign of King Wawa of Mataram (924–929 CE), 
    Merapi erupted and devastated the kingdom's capital in Mataram.

    <strong>Majapahit Empire (1293–1527)</strong>

    During the Majapahit era, the area surrounding modern Yogyakarta was identified again as "Mataram" and recognised as one of the twelve Majapahit provinces in Java ruled by Bhre Mataram. During the reign of the fourth king of the Majapahit Empire, the Hindu King Hayam Wuruk (1350–1389) of the Rajasa dynasty,
     the title of Bhre Mataram was held by the king's nephew and son-in-law Wikramawardhana, later the fifth king of Majapahit.
