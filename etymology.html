        Yogyakarta is named after the Indian city of Ayodhya, the birthplace of the eponymous hero Rama from the Ramayana epic. Yogya means "suitable; fit; proper", and karta means "prosperous; flourishing". Thus, Yogyakarta means fit to prosper".
In colonial era correspondence, the city is often written in the Javanese script as ꦔꦪꦺꦴꦒꦾꦏꦂꦠ, read as /ŋajoɡjakarta/ with the added prefix nga-. In the orthography of the time, the proper name was spelt with the Latin alphabet as "Jogjakarta". As the orthography of the Indonesian language changed, the consonant /j/ came to be written with ⟨y⟩, and the consonant /dʒ/ with ⟨j⟩. 
Personal and geographical names however, were allowed to maintain their original spelling according to contemporary Indonesian orthography. 
Thus, the city can be written as "Yogyakarta", which is true to its original pronunciation and the Javanese script spelling, or "Jogjakarta",
 which is true to the old Dutch spelling and reflects popular pronunciation today, but differs from the original Ayodhya etymology. 
One may encounter either "Yogyakarta" or "Jogjakarta" in contemporary documents.
